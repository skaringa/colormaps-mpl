# ColorMaps from matplotlib

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a Processing library containing the color maps from Python's matplotlib.

Colormaps convert numerical values into colors. They are widely used to display measurements or statistical data in a way that's easy for humans to understand, but they are also extremely useful for creating beautiful, computed pictures.

Creating effective and aesthetically pleasing colormaps is a difficult task. Fortunately, many have already invested significant effort into this and have published their work in the public domain. The [colormaps included in Python's matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html) are a great example of this.
