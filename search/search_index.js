They are widely used to display measurements or statistical data in a way that's easy for humans to understand, but they are also extremely useful for creating beautiful, computed pictures.</p> <p>Creating effective and aesthetically pleasing colormaps is a difficult task. Fortunately, many have already invested significant effort into this and have published their work in the public domain. The colormaps included in Python's matplotlib are a great example of this.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#contents","title":"Contents","text":"<ol> <li>Installation</li> <li>Usage</li> <li>Reference</li> <li>Contributors</li> </ol>"},{"location":"contributors.html","title":"Contributors","text":"<p>Many thanks to the The Matplotlib development team and all contributors of Matplotlib and Processing!</p>"},{"location":"installation.html","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Download the library from the release page and extract ColorMapsMPL.zip into the library folder below your sketchbook folder.</p>"},{"location":"reference.html","title":"Reference","text":""},{"location":"reference.html#colormap-reference","title":"Colormap reference","text":""},{"location":"reference.html#javadoc-documentation","title":"Javadoc Documentation","text":"<p>The Javadoc documentation is included in the distribution's ZIP file.

All names that are currently registered in the ColorMapRegistry may be retrieved with:</p> <pre><code>creg.getAllNames();\n</code></pre> <p>Retrieve and use the colors:</p> <p>To retrieve the color for value val:</p> <pre><code>int color = cmap.getColor(val);\n</code></pre> <p>The argument val must no exceed the range of <code>0</code> to <code>cmap.size()-1</code>. For most colormaps, this is the range from 0 to 255 (inclusive). However, colormaps from the Qualitative category often have fewer colors, so be sure to use Processing's  <code>map</code> function to map your data range to the number of available colors..</p> <p>The result is a 32-bit value ordered as AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGBBBBBBBB, which can be fed directly into Processing's <code>fill</code>, <code>stroke</code> or <code>background</code> functions, if the default RGB color model is active.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <p>For example, if we have a variable <code>val</code> with values in the range <code>minVal..maxVal</code> and want to represent this variable as a fill color, we would use:</p> <pre><code>colorMode(RGB); // can be omitted as this is the default setting\n\nint icol = (int)map(val, minVal, maxVal, 0, cmap.size()-1);\nfill(cmap.getColor(icol));\n</code></pre>"}]}
